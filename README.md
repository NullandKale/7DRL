A Seven Day Rogue-Like

Apocatastasis is a game created in only 7 days. We are currently on day 5, so why is this here, ready for download? We want immediate feedback, to help balance combat and improve the game. To get the game you have two choices, you can download and play the version [here](https://nullandkale.itch.io/apocatastasis), or you can download the source from github and compile the project yourself.

Now that you have the game how do you give us feedback? The best way is through the discord chat [here](https://discord.gg/eAzgQyn).
